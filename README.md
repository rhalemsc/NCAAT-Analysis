Analysis of the NCAA men's basketball tournament data <br>

### Tournament-Stats.ipnyb
In this notebook I take a look at treds related to tournament seeding. I am particularly interested in spotting upsets based on seeding. Some questions I'm interested in answering are:
- If a weaker seed is paired with a stronger seed, what's the probability that the weaker seed will win, given historical data?
- How often does a weaker seed make it far in the tournament?
- In which round do the most upsets occur?
